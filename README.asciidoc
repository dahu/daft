__Diagnose Aberrant FileType plugins__

TIP: If you like Daft and want to share the W00t!, I'm grateful for

+:Punk+

The command:

  :Punk java

will show the additional +filetype+ plugins loaded for Java files.

NOTE: Daft makes no attempt to do this on a clean Vim. The user is
responsible for ensuring that state. That is, multiple runs will show no
extra scripts being loaded.
